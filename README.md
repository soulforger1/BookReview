## I worked on -Book Review- site as side project to learn more about graphql & mongoDB

## Front-end:
  - Used ReactJs with Tailwind in order to fast development.
  - If you want run on your computer you can start locally by running this command from front-end folder.
  
    ```zsh
       yarn start or npm start
    ```
   
  Most challenging part of front-end was using apollo for send request to graphql server
 
## Back-end:
  - Used Express & Graphql with mongoDB as database.
  - You can start server by this command.

    ```zsh
       yarn start or npm start
    ```
    
  I gained lot of experience about how to connect mongodb with graphql and express. I really liked Graphql i think i will use this on many other projects ðŸ˜„. On front-end i tried tailwind because of many people says that how amazing this library is.
